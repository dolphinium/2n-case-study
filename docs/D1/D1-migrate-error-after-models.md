The error you're encountering stems from an incorrect reference to your custom `User` model in the Django settings. Specifically, Django expects model references in the format `'app_label.ModelName'`, where `app_label` is the **label** of the app, not the full Python path.

Let's break down the issue and provide a step-by-step solution to resolve it.

---

### **Understanding the Error**

**Error Message:**
```
ValueError: Invalid model reference 'backend.employees.User'. String model references must be of the form 'app_label.ModelName'.
```

**Cause:**
- Django is trying to interpret `'backend.employees.User'` as an `'app_label.ModelName'`.
- However, `'backend.employees.User'` includes the project/module path (`backend.`), which is not expected.
- Django expects the `app_label` to be the **app name** (`employees`) rather than the full path.

---

### **Solution Steps**

1. **Update `AUTH_USER_MODEL` in `settings.py`**
2. **Verify `apps.py` Configuration**
3. **Check for Incorrect Model References**
4. **Clear Migration Files (If Necessary)**
5. **Run Migrations Successfully**
6. **Verify the Setup**

Let's go through each step in detail.

---

#### **1. Update `AUTH_USER_MODEL` in `settings.py`**

Your current `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting is:

```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'backend.employees.User'
```

**This is incorrect** because it includes the project/module path (`backend.employees`). Django expects only the `app_label` and `ModelName`.

**Update it to:**

```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'employees.User'
```

**Why?**
- `app_label` is derived from the app's name (`employees`), not the full path.
- This aligns with Django's expectation of the format `'app_label.ModelName'`.

**Updated `settings.py`:**

```python
# ... (other settings)

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    'rest_framework',
    'backend.employees.apps.EmployeesConfig',  # Ensure this is correctly specified
]

# ... (other settings)

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'employees.User'  # Corrected

# ... (other settings)
```

---

#### **2. Verify `apps.py` Configuration**

Ensure that your `apps.py` correctly defines the app configuration.

**Path:** `backend/employees/apps.py`

**Content:**

```python
from django.apps import AppConfig

class EmployeesConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
    name = 'backend.employees'  # This should be the full Python path to the app
```

**Key Points:**
- The `name` attribute should be the **full Python path** to the app (`backend.employees`).
- Django will automatically derive the `app_label` from the last part of the path (`employees`).

---

#### **3. Check for Incorrect Model References**

The error may originate from your models or signals where you've referenced `'backend.employees.User'` instead of `'employees.User'`.

**Action Steps:**

- **Search for String References:** Look for any string references in your models, signals, or other parts of the code where you might have used `'backend.employees.User'`.

- **Common Places to Check:**
  - **ForeignKey or ManyToMany Fields:** Ensure that custom user references use the correct format.
  - **Signals:** Check the signal receivers for proper model references.

**Example Correction:**

**Before:**
```python
# Incorrect reference
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models

class SomeModel(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey('backend.employees.User', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

**After:**
```python
# Correct reference
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models

class SomeModel(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # Alternatively:
    # user = models.ForeignKey('employees.User', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

**Best Practice:**
- Use `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` for referencing the custom user model to ensure flexibility and avoid hardcoding the app label.

---

#### **4. Clear Migration Files (If Necessary)**

If you've already created migration files with incorrect references, you might need to reset migrations.

⚠️ **Warning:** **Only perform the following steps if you are in the early stages of development and it's safe to lose existing migrations and data.** Avoid doing this in a production environment.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Delete Migration Files:**

   Navigate to the `migrations` folder inside the `employees` app and delete all files except `__init__.py`.

   ```bash
   rm backend/employees/migrations/0*.py
   ```

2. **Reset the Database (Optional):**

   If you're in development and can afford to lose data, drop the existing database and create a new one.

   ```bash
   psql -U admin -d backend_db
   ```

   Inside the `psql` shell:

   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE backend_db;
   CREATE DATABASE backend_db OWNER admin;
   \q
   ```

---

#### **5. Run Migrations Successfully**

After making the above corrections, proceed to make and apply migrations.

**Steps:**

1. **Make Migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```

   This should create the necessary migration files without errors.

2. **Apply Migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

   This should apply migrations to the database successfully.

---

#### **6. Verify the Setup**

1. **Create a Superuser (If Not Already Created):**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set up the superuser credentials.

2. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. **Access the Admin Interface:**

   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` in your browser.
   - Log in using the superuser credentials.
   - Ensure that the `employees` app and its models are visible and accessible.

---

### **Summary of Changes**

1. **`settings.py` Adjustments:**
   - **Correct `AUTH_USER_MODEL`:**
     ```python
     AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'employees.User'
     ```
   - **Ensure `INSTALLED_APPS` is Correctly Specified:**
     ```python
     INSTALLED_APPS = [
         # ... other apps ...
         'rest_framework',
         'backend.employees.apps.EmployeesConfig',
     ]
     ```

2. **`apps.py` Configuration:**
   - Ensure the `name` attribute is correctly set to `'backend.employees'`.

3. **Model References:**
   - Replace any instances of `'backend.employees.User'` with `'employees.User'` or use `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`.

4. **Migration Reset (If Applicable):**
   - Delete existing migrations and reset the database as needed.

5. **Testing:**
   - Successfully make and apply migrations.
   - Verify functionality via the admin interface.

---

### **Final Recommendations**

- **Use `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`:**
  - Throughout your project, always reference the custom user model using `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` to ensure consistency and flexibility.
  
  **Example:**
  ```python
  from django.conf import settings
  from django.db import models

  class SomeModel(models.Model):
      user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
  ```

- **Avoid Hardcoding App Labels:**
  - Instead of string literals like `'employees.User'`, utilize Django settings or direct model imports to maintain consistency.

- **Consistent App Structure:**
  - Keeping your apps within the project directory (`backend/employees`) is a good practice for organization and scalability.

- **Version Control Best Practices:**
  - After making these changes, ensure you commit them to your Git repository to keep track of your progress.

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Fix AUTH_USER_MODEL reference and update INSTALLED_APPS"
  git push origin main
  ```

---

### **If Issues Persist**

If, after following these steps, you still encounter errors, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check All Model References:**
   - Ensure no residual references point to the incorrect model path.

2. **Clear Python Bytecode Files:**
   - Sometimes, stale `.pyc` files can cause issues.

   ```bash
   find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
   ```

3. **Use Django's Check Command:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py check
   ```

   This command can identify potential configuration issues.

4. **Review Signal Implementations:**
   - Ensure that your `signals.py` does not reference models using the incorrect path.

   **Example:**

   **Before:**
   ```python
   @receiver(post_save, sender='backend.employees.User')
   def create_employee_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
       if created:
           EmployeeProfile.objects.create(user=instance, full_name=instance.username)
   ```

   **After:**
   ```python
   from django.conf import settings

   @receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
   def create_employee_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
       if created:
           EmployeeProfile.objects.create(user=instance, full_name=instance.username)
   ```

5. **Ensure All `__init__.py` Files Are Present:**
   - This makes sure Python treats directories as packages.

   ```bash
   touch backend/__init__.py
   touch backend/employees/__init__.py
   touch backend/employees/migrations/__init__.py
   ```

6. **Restart Your Development Server:**
   - Sometimes, changes require a server restart to take effect.

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

---

By carefully updating the `AUTH_USER_MODEL`, ensuring proper app configuration, and verifying all model references, you should be able to resolve the migration error and proceed with your project seamlessly.

The error you're encountering:

```
ValueError: Dependency on app with no migrations: employees
```

indicates that Django is attempting to process migrations that depend on the `employees` app, but it hasn't found any migration files for that app. This typically happens when:

1. **The `employees` app doesn't have any migration files yet.**
2. **There are dependencies in other migration files that reference the `employees` app.**

Given the steps you've taken, particularly moving the `employees` app inside the `backend` directory and setting up a custom `User` model, it's crucial to ensure that Django correctly recognizes and processes the `employees` app and its migrations.

Let's systematically address and resolve this issue.

---

### **1. Verify and Correct the `apps.py` Configuration**

**Path:** `backend/employees/apps.py`

Ensure that the `EmployeesConfig` class correctly defines the app's name and label. The `label` should be set to `'employees'` to match the `AUTH_USER_MODEL`.

```python
# backend/employees/apps.py

from django.apps import AppConfig

class EmployeesConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
    name = 'backend.employees'  # Full Python path to the app
    label = 'employees'         # Sets the app label to 'employees'
```

**Explanation:**

- **`name`**: This should be the full Python path to the app (`backend.employees`).
- **`label`**: By setting this to `'employees'`, you ensure that Django recognizes the app label correctly, which aligns with the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting.

---

### **2. Ensure Presence of `__init__.py` Files**

Django requires `__init__.py` files in app directories to recognize them as Python packages.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Check for `__init__.py` in `backend/employees/migrations/`:**

   **Path:** `backend/employees/migrations/__init__.py`

   If it doesn't exist, create it:

   ```bash
   touch backend/employees/migrations/__init__.py
   ```

2. **Verify Other Necessary `__init__.py` Files:**

   Ensure that both `backend/` and `backend/employees/` directories contain an `__init__.py` file.

   ```bash
   touch backend/__init__.py
   touch backend/employees/__init__.py
   ```

---

### **3. Update the `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`**

**Path:** `backend/settings.py`

Your current `INSTALLED_APPS` includes:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    'rest_framework',
    'backend.employees',  # Ensure this is correctly specified
]
```

**Correction:**

Given that you've set the `label` in `apps.py`, it's better to reference the app using its AppConfig.

**Updated `INSTALLED_APPS`:**

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    'rest_framework',
    'backend.employees.apps.EmployeesConfig',  # Use the AppConfig path
]
```

**Explanation:**

Using the AppConfig path (`'backend.employees.apps.EmployeesConfig'`) ensures that Django correctly interprets the app's configuration, including the custom `label`.

---

### **4. Correct the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` Setting**

**Path:** `backend/settings.py`

Your current `AUTH_USER_MODEL` is set to:

```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'employees.User'
```

**Ensure this matches the app label defined in `apps.py`.**

**Validation:**

- **App Label:** `'employees'` (set in `apps.py`)
- **Model Name:** `'User'`

Thus, the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting is correct.

**No Change Needed:**

```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'employees.User'
```

---

### **5. Create Initial Migrations for the `employees` App**

Since the `employees` app is new and may have custom models (like the custom `User` model), you need to create initial migration files.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Ensure You're in the Correct Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Run `makemigrations` Specifically for the `employees` App:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations employees
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Migrations for 'employees':
     backend/employees/migrations/0001_initial.py
       - Create model User
       - Create model EmployeeProfile
       - Create model AttendanceRecord
       - Create model LeaveRequest
       - Create model Notification
       - Create model MonthlyReport
   ```

3. **If No Changes Are Detected:**

   - **Ensure That Models Are Properly Defined:** Check `backend/employees/models.py` for any syntax errors or incorrect model references.
   - **Check for Circular Imports:** Make sure that your `models.py` doesn't import from other modules in a way that causes circular dependencies.

---

### **6. Apply Migrations**

After successfully creating migration files, apply them to set up the database schema.

**Action Steps:**

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

**Expected Outcome:**

All migrations, including those for the `employees` app, should apply without errors.

---

### **7. Verify the Migration Setup**

1. **Create a Superuser (If Not Already Created):**

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set up a superuser account.

2. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. **Access the Django Admin Interface:**

   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` in your browser and log in using the superuser credentials.

4. **Check the `employees` App:**

   Ensure that all models (`User`, `EmployeeProfile`, `AttendanceRecord`, `LeaveRequest`, `Notification`, `MonthlyReport`) are present and accessible in the admin interface.

---

### **8. Commit Changes to GitHub**

After resolving the migration issues and ensuring everything works correctly, commit your changes to version control.

**Action Steps:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix migration errors: Configure app label and create initial migrations for employees app"
git push origin main
```

---

### **Summary of Steps to Resolve the Migration Error**

1. **Configure `apps.py`:**
   - Set `name` to `'backend.employees'`.
   - Set `label` to `'employees'`.

2. **Ensure `__init__.py` Files Exist:** Protect Python package recognition.

3. **Update `INSTALLED_APPS`:**
   - Use the AppConfig path: `'backend.employees.apps.EmployeesConfig'`.

4. **Verify `AUTH_USER_MODEL`:**
   - Ensure it's set to `'employees.User'`.

5. **Create Initial Migrations for `employees`:**
   - Run `python manage.py makemigrations employees`.

6. **Apply Migrations:**
   - Run `python manage.py migrate`.

7. **Verify Functionality:**
   - Create a superuser, run the server, and check the admin interface.

8. **Commit Changes to GitHub:**
   - Keep your version control updated with the fixes.

---

### **Additional Considerations**

- **Using `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` in Model References:**

  To ensure consistency and avoid hardcoding the model reference, always use `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` when referring to the custom `User` model in your models.

  **Example:**

  ```python
  # backend/employees/models.py

  from django.conf import settings
  from django.db import models

  class EmployeeProfile(models.Model):
      user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='profile')
      full_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
      department = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      position = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      annual_leave_balance = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=15)

      def __str__(self):
          return self.full_name
  ```

- **Signals:**

  When using signals to auto-create profiles upon user creation, ensure that you're referencing the `User` model correctly.

  **Example:**

  ```python
  # backend/employees/signals.py

  from django.db.models.signals import post_save
  from django.dispatch import receiver
  from django.conf import settings
  from .models import EmployeeProfile

  @receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
  def create_employee_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
      if created:
          EmployeeProfile.objects.create(user=instance, full_name=instance.username)

  @receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
  def save_employee_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs):
      instance.profile.save()
  ```

  **Note:** Use `sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` instead of a string reference to ensure Django correctly resolves the custom `User` model.

- **Check for Circular Dependencies:**

  If your models or signals import each other in a way that causes circular dependencies, Django may fail to process migrations. Review your model and signal imports to prevent this.

- **Using `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` Everywhere:**

  For any foreign keys or references to the `User` model, always use `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` or the registered model reference to maintain flexibility.

---

### **Final Steps**

After performing the above steps, your Django project should successfully recognize the `employees` app, have the necessary migrations in place, and be ready for further development. If you continue to encounter issues, consider the following:

1. **Clear Migration Files and Retry (Only if Safe):**

   If the project is still in early development and it's safe to reset migrations, you can delete existing migration files and reset the database.

   **Action Steps:**

   ```bash
   # Delete all migration files except __init__.py
   find backend/employees/migrations -type f -not -name '__init__.py' -delete

   # Drop and recreate the database (if safe)
   psql -U admin -d backend_db
   ```

   Inside the `psql` shell:

   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE backend_db;
   CREATE DATABASE backend_db OWNER admin;
   \q
   ```

   Then, recreate the migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations employees
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Inspect All Migration Files for Incorrect Dependencies:**

   Ensure that no migration file incorrectly references `'backend.employees.User'` or any other improper app labels.

3. **Use Django's Check Command:**

   This command can help identify configuration issues.

   ```bash
   python manage.py check
   ```

4. **Review Model Definitions:**

   Ensure that all models are correctly defined without syntax errors or incorrect relationships.

5. **Seek Specific Error Messages and Stack Traces:**

   If new errors arise, analyze the stack traces to pinpoint the exact issue.

---

By following these comprehensive steps, you should be able to resolve the migration errors and have your Django project correctly configured to use the `employees` app with a custom `User` model.

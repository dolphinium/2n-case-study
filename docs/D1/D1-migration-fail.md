The error you're encountering:

```
django.db.migrations.exceptions.InconsistentMigrationHistory: Migration admin.0001_initial is applied before its dependency employees.0001_initial on database 'default'.
```

indicates that Django's migration system is trying to apply the `admin` app's initial migration (`admin.0001_initial`) before the `employees` app's initial migration (`employees.0001_initial`). However, since the `employees` app's migration hasn't been applied yet, Django detects an inconsistency in the migration history.

This situation often arises in one of the following scenarios:

1. **Incomplete Migrations for the `employees` App:** The `employees` app hasn't created or applied its initial migrations.
2. **Incorrect Dependency Configuration:** Other apps or migrations incorrectly reference the `employees` app before its migrations are applied.
3. **Migration Files Out of Sync:** Migration files might be missing or corrupted, leading to inconsistencies.

Given that you're still in the initial stages of development, resetting the migrations and the database is the most straightforward solution. However, **⚠️ **Important:**** This approach will **delete all data** in your current database. Ensure that you **do not have important data** or **back it up** if necessary before proceeding.

### **Step-by-Step Solution to Resolve Migration Inconsistencies**

#### **1. Verify the `employees` App Configuration**

Before proceeding, ensure that your `employees` app is correctly configured.

- **`apps.py`:**

  ```python
  # backend/employees/apps.py

  from django.apps import AppConfig

  class EmployeesConfig(AppConfig):
      default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
      name = 'backend.employees'
      label = 'employees'  # Ensure the label is set correctly
  ```

  **Note:**
  - The `name` attribute should be the full Python path to the app (`backend.employees`).
  - The `label` attribute is optional but can help ensure Django correctly identifies the app.

- **`__init__.py` Files:**

  Ensure that all necessary directories contain an `__init__.py` file. This includes:

  - `backend/__init__.py`
  - `backend/employees/__init__.py`
  - `backend/employees/migrations/__init__.py`

  If any are missing, create them:

  ```bash
  touch backend/__init__.py
  touch backend/employees/__init__.py
  touch backend/employees/migrations/__init__.py
  ```

#### **2. Update `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`**

Ensure that your `INSTALLED_APPS` correctly references the `employees` app using its `AppConfig`.

```python
# backend/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    'rest_framework',
    'backend.employees.apps.EmployeesConfig',  # Use AppConfig path
]
```

**Ensure that:**
- You **do not** include `.name` when specifying the app. It should only reference the `AppConfig` class path.
- The `AUTH_USER_MODEL` is correctly set to `'employees.User'` as you had:

  ```python
  AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'employees.User'
  ```

#### **3. Reset Migrations for the `employees` App**

Since the migration history is inconsistent, it's best to reset the migrations. Follow these steps:

**⚠️ Warning:** This process will **delete all existing migration files** for the `employees` app and **reset the database**, which will **erase all data**. Proceed only if you're certain this won't impact important data.

##### **a. Delete Existing Migration Files**

Navigate to the `migrations` directory within the `employees` app and delete all migration files except `__init__.py`.

```bash
cd backend/employees/migrations/
ls
# You should see files like 0001_initial.py, 0002_auto_..., etc., along with __init__.py
# Delete them:
rm 00*.py
# Ensure __init__.py remains
```

##### **b. Drop and Recreate the Database**

Using `psql`, drop the existing database and create a new one.

1. **Access PostgreSQL as the `admin` User:**

   ```bash
   psql -U admin
   ```

   If prompted for a password, enter `admin` as per your configuration.

2. **Drop the Existing Database:**

   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE db_2n;
   ```

   If the database doesn't exist, you'll get an error. Proceed in that case.

3. **Create a New Database:**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE db_2n OWNER admin;
   ```

4. **Exit `psql`:**

   ```sql
   \q
   ```

##### **c. Recreate Migrations**

With a clean slate, recreate the initial migrations for the `employees` app.

1. **Navigate Back to the Project Root:**

   ```bash
   cd ../../../  # Adjust the path accordingly
   ```

2. **Make Migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations employees
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Migrations for 'employees':
     backend/employees/migrations/0001_initial.py
       - Create model User
       - Create model EmployeeProfile
       - Create model AttendanceRecord
       - Create model LeaveRequest
       - Create model Notification
       - Create model MonthlyReport
   ```

   **Note:** If you encounter errors during this step, ensure that your models are correctly defined without any syntax errors or incorrect references.

##### **d. Apply Migrations**

Now, apply the migrations to set up the database schema.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

**Expected Outcome:**

All migrations, including those for the `employees` app, should apply without errors.

#### **4. Verify the Migration Setup**

After successfully applying migrations, verify that everything is functioning correctly.

##### **a. Create a Superuser**

If you haven't already, create a superuser to access the Django admin interface.

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up the superuser credentials.

##### **b. Run the Development Server**

Start the development server to ensure that the application runs without issues.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

##### **c. Access the Admin Interface**

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.
2. Log in using the superuser credentials you just created.
3. Verify that the `employees` app and its models (`User`, `EmployeeProfile`, `AttendanceRecord`, `LeaveRequest`, `Notification`, `MonthlyReport`) are visible and accessible.

#### **5. Commit Changes to GitHub**

After resolving the migration issues and verifying that everything works correctly, ensure that your changes are committed to version control.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Reset migrations and recreate database for employees app"
git push origin main
```

#### **6. Additional Best Practices and Tips**

- **Use `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` in Model References:**

  To maintain consistency and flexibility, always reference the custom user model using `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` instead of hardcoding the model path.

  **Example:**

  ```python
  # backend/employees/models.py

  from django.conf import settings
  from django.db import models

  class EmployeeProfile(models.Model):
      user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='profile')
      full_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
      department = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      position = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      annual_leave_balance = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=15)

      def __str__(self):
          return self.full_name
  ```

- **Ensure Correct Signal References:**

  When using signals to automatically create related models (e.g., `EmployeeProfile` upon creating a `User`), reference the custom user model correctly.

  **Example:**

  ```python
  # backend/employees/signals.py

  from django.db.models.signals import post_save
  from django.dispatch import receiver
  from django.conf import settings
  from .models import EmployeeProfile

  @receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
  def create_employee_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
      if created:
          EmployeeProfile.objects.create(user=instance, full_name=instance.username)

  @receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
  def save_employee_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs):
      instance.profile.save()
  ```

- **Avoid Circular Imports:**

  Ensure that your models and signals don't import each other in a way that causes circular dependencies. Use `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` and Django's string references where appropriate to prevent this.

- **Regularly Run Django's Check Command:**

  Django provides a helpful `check` command to identify potential issues in your project.

  ```bash
  python manage.py check
  ```

  This command can help you catch configuration errors before they cause runtime issues.

- **Use Virtual Environments Exclusively:**

  Ensure that you're always operating within your project's virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages.

  ```bash
  # Activate your virtual environment
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

  **Note:** Replace `venv` with the name of your virtual environment if it's different.

- **Clear Python Bytecode Files:**

  Sometimes, stale `.pyc` files can cause unexpected behavior. Clear them if you encounter strange issues.

  ```bash
  find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -r {} +
  ```

#### **7. Final Verification**

After following all the above steps, perform the following checks to ensure everything is working as expected:

1. **Run Migrations:**

   Ensure that all migrations are applied without errors.

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Access Django Admin:**

   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.
   - Log in with your superuser credentials.
   - Verify that all models under the `employees` app are present and functional.

3. **Create Test Data:**

   - Add a new `User` via the admin interface.
   - Ensure that an `EmployeeProfile` is automatically created for the `User`.
   - Check that related models (e.g., `AttendanceRecord`, `LeaveRequest`, etc.) can be created and linked appropriately.

4. **Run the Development Server:**

   Start the server and interact with your application to ensure overall functionality.

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

#### **8. If Issues Persist**

If you still encounter migration errors after following the above steps, consider the following:

- **Inspect Migration Dependencies:**

  Open your migration files (e.g., `backend/employees/migrations/0001_initial.py`) and ensure that dependencies are correctly set.

  **Example:**

  ```python
  # backend/employees/migrations/0001_initial.py

  from django.db import migrations, models
  import django.contrib.auth.models
  import django.utils.timezone

  class Migration(migrations.Migration):

      initial = True

      dependencies = [
          ('auth', '0012_alter_user_first_name_max_length'),  # Ensure dependencies are correct
      ]

      operations = [
          migrations.CreateModel(
              name='User',
              fields=[
                  # Define your custom User model fields here
              ],
              options={
                  'abstract': False,
              },
              managers=[
                  ('objects', django.contrib.auth.models.UserManager()),
              ],
          ),
          # Other CreateModel operations
      ]
  ```

  **Ensure:**
  - Dependencies are specified correctly, especially if your models depend on other apps.
  - No erroneous dependencies referencing `backend.employees.User`.

- **Check for Duplicate `User` Models:**

  Ensure that no other app within your project defines a `User` model or improperly references your custom `User` model.

- **Review All Import Statements:**

  Make sure all imports related to the `User` model use `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` or reference `'employees.User'` correctly.

- **Use Django's `makemigrations` with Verbose Output:**

  Gain more insight into potential issues by running `makemigrations` with verbosity.

  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations --verbosity 3
  ```

- **Seek Specific Error Messages:**

  If a new error arises, analyze the full stack trace to determine the source.

#### **9. Example of Proper Model and Signal Configuration**

**`models.py`:**

```python
# backend/employees/models.py

from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class User(AbstractUser):
    is_authorized = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username

class EmployeeProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField('employees.User', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='profile')
    full_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    department = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    position = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    annual_leave_balance = models.PositiveIntegerField(default=15)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.full_name

class AttendanceRecord(models.Model):
    employee = models.ForeignKey('employees.User', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='attendance_records')
    date = models.DateField()
    first_check_in = models.TimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    last_check_out = models.TimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    is_late = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    lateness_duration = models.DurationField(null=True, blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.employee.username} - {self.date}"

# Define other models similarly...
```

**`signals.py`:**

```python
# backend/employees/signals.py

from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.conf import settings
from .models import EmployeeProfile

@receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
def create_employee_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        EmployeeProfile.objects.create(user=instance, full_name=instance.username)

@receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
def save_employee_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    instance.profile.save()
```

**`__init__.py`:**

Ensure that `backend/employees/__init__.py` imports signals to ensure they're registered.

```python
# backend/employees/__init__.py

default_app_config = 'backend.employees.apps.EmployeesConfig'

# Import signals
from . import signals
```

#### **10. Complete `apps.py` Configuration**

Ensure that `apps.py` correctly references the app's path and label.

```python
# backend/employees/apps.py

from django.apps import AppConfig

class EmployeesConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
    name = 'backend.employees'
    label = 'employees'  # Optional but recommended
```

---

### **Summary**

By resetting both the migration files and the database, you allow Django to recreate the migration history from scratch, ensuring that dependencies are correctly managed. Here's a quick recap of the steps:

1. **Ensure Correct App Configuration:**
   - Properly set `name` and `label` in `apps.py`.
   - Correctly reference the app in `INSTALLED_APPS`.

2. **Reset Migrations:**
   - Delete existing migration files for the `employees` app.
   - Drop and recreate the PostgreSQL database.

3. **Recreate Migrations:**
   - Run `makemigrations` for the `employees` app.
   - Apply migrations with `migrate`.

4. **Verify Functionality:**
   - Create a superuser.
   - Access the Django admin interface to ensure models are correctly registered.

5. **Commit Changes:**
   - Push the updated configuration and migration history to your GitHub repository.

Following these steps should resolve the migration inconsistencies and allow you to proceed with developing your application. If you encounter further issues, please provide additional error messages or context, and I'll be happy to assist you further.

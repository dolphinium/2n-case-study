Apologies for the confusion and inconvenience you've encountered. The errors you're facing stem from the fact that the `User` and `Notification` models are not properly imported or defined in the context where they're being used. Let's address this step-by-step to ensure your application functions correctly.

---

### **Understanding the Issue**

**Error Context:**
```python
def notify_authorized_users_late(employee, date, lateness, deduction):
    # Get all authorized users
    authorized_users = User.objects.filter(is_authorized=True)
    message = f"Employee {employee.username} was late on {date} by {lateness.seconds // 60} minutes and {deduction} days were deducted from their leave."
    for user in authorized_users:
        Notification.objects.create(recipient=user, message=message)
```

**Problem:**
- **`User` Object Undefined:** Django cannot recognize what `User` refers to in this context.
- **`Notification` Object Undefined:** Similarly, Django doesn't know about the `Notification` model here.

---

### **Step-by-Step Solution**

To resolve these issues, you need to ensure that both the `User` and `Notification` models are correctly imported in the file where the `notify_authorized_users_late` function resides. Here's how you can fix it:

#### **1. Import the Custom User Model Correctly**

Since you've defined a custom `User` model in the `employees` app and set it as the default user model in `settings.py`:

```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'employees.User'
```

You should use Django's `get_user_model` function to reference it. This ensures that Django always refers to the correct `User` model, especially if you change it in the future.

**Implementation:**

1. **Import `get_user_model`:**

   At the top of your `views.py` (or the relevant file where the function is defined), add:

   ```python
   from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
   ```

2. **Set the `User` Variable:**

   ```python
   User = get_user_model()
   ```

   This line assigns your custom `User` model to the variable `User`, making it accessible throughout the file.

#### **2. Import the `Notification` Model Correctly**

Ensure that the `Notification` model is properly defined and imported from the `employees` app.

**Implementation:**

1. **Define the `Notification` Model (If Not Already Defined):**

   In your `employees/models.py`, ensure the `Notification` model is defined as follows:

   ```python
   # backend/employees/models.py

   from django.db import models
   from django.conf import settings

   class Notification(models.Model):
       recipient = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='notifications')
       message = models.TextField()
       is_read = models.BooleanField(default=False)
       timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

       def __str__(self):
           return f"Notification to {self.recipient.username} at {self.timestamp}"
   ```

2. **Import the `Notification` Model in `views.py`:**

   Add the following import statement at the top of your `views.py`:

   ```python
   from .models import Notification
   ```

   This imports the `Notification` model from the current app (`employees`).

#### **3. Complete Example of Updated `views.py`**

Here's how your `views.py` should look after making the necessary imports and ensuring the function is correctly defined:

                if profile.annual_leave_balance >= deduction:
                    profile.annual_leave_balance -= deduction
                    profile.save()
                    attendance.leave_deducted = deduction

            attendance.save()
            return redirect('personnel_dashboard')
    else:
        form = CheckInForm()

    context = {
        'form': form
    }
    return render(request, 'employees/attendance_check_in.html', context)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Imports Added:**
   - `from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model`: To reference the custom `User` model.
   - `from .models import Notification`: To use the `Notification` model.

2. **Assigned `User` Variable:**
   - `User = get_user_model()`: Ensures that `User` refers to your custom `User` model.

3. **Updated Notification Functions:**
   - Updated all `notify_*` functions to:
     - Use the correct `User` model.
     - Import and create `Notification` instances appropriately.
     - Enqueue Celery tasks (`send_notifications.delay()`) for asynchronous handling.

4. **Example Attendance Check-In View Updated:**
   - Demonstrates how to incorporate leave deductions and notifications within the `attendance_check_in` view.

#### **4. Ensure `EmployeeProfile` and Related Models Are Properly Defined**

**`EmployeeProfile` Model:**
```python
# backend/employees/models.py

from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

class User(AbstractUser):
    is_authorized = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username

class EmployeeProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='profile')
    full_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    department = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    position = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    annual_leave_balance = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2, default=15.00)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.full_name

# Signals to automatically create or update EmployeeProfile
@receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
def create_employee_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        EmployeeProfile.objects.create(user=instance, full_name=instance.username)

@receiver(post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL)
def save_employee_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    instance.profile.save()
```

**Key Points:**

- **One-to-One Relationship:** Ensures that each `User` has one `EmployeeProfile`.
- **Signals:** Automatically create and save `EmployeeProfile` instances when `User` instances are created or saved.

### **5. Final Steps: Making and Applying Migrations**

After ensuring that all models are correctly defined and imported, follow these steps to apply migrations:

1. **Make Migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations employees
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Migrations for 'employees':
     backend/employees/migrations/0002_auto_20231023_1234.py
       - Alter field user on employeeprofile
       - Add field leave_deducted to attendancerecord
       - Add field days to leaverequest
   ```

2. **Apply Migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

   **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Applying employees.0002_auto_20231023_1234... OK
   ```

---

### **6. Testing the Fix**

1. **Run the Development Server:**

   Start your Django development server to ensure that everything works as expected.

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Access the Application:**

   - **Personnel Actions:**
     - Log in as a Personnel user.
     - Perform a Check-In and Check-Out.
     - Verify that automatic deductions occur based on lateness.
     - Check that notifications are created for Authorized Users.

   - **Authorized User Actions:**
     - Log in as an Authorized User.
     - Access the dashboard to view notifications about employee lateness and low leave balances.
     - Ensure that notifications appear correctly and are marked as read once viewed.

3. **Verify Notifications:**

   - Ensure that `Notification` objects are being created correctly in the database.
   - Confirm that Authorized Users receive the intended notifications when employees are late or have low leave balances.

---

### **7. Additional Recommendations**

1. **Use Django's Logging Framework:**

   To monitor and debug your application more effectively, set up Django's logging.

   ```python
   # backend/settings.py

   LOGGING = {
       'version': 1,
       'disable_existing_loggers': False,
       'handlers': {
           'console': {
               'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
           },
       },
       'root': {
           'handlers': ['console'],
           'level': 'INFO',
       },
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Unit Tests:**

   Writing tests ensures that your functions work as intended and helps prevent future regressions.

   ```python
   # backend/employees/tests.py

   from django.test import TestCase
   from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
   from .models import AttendanceRecord, Notification

   User = get_user_model()

   class AttendanceTestCase(TestCase):
       def setUp(self):
           self.personnel_user = User.objects.create_user(username='john_personnel', password='password123', is_authorized=False)
           self.authorized_user = User.objects.create_user(username='jane_authorized', password='password123', is_authorized=True)

       def test_check_in_late_deduction(self):
           self.client.login(username='john_personnel', password='password123')
           response = self.client.post('/auth/attendance/check-in/', {'check_in_time': '08:45'})
           self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 302)  # Redirect after successful check-in

           attendance = AttendanceRecord.objects.get(employee=self.personnel_user, date=timezone.now().date())
           self.assertTrue(attendance.is_late)
           self.assertEqual(attendance.leave_deducted, 0.75)  # 45 minutes late -> 0.75 days deducted

           # Check Notification
           notifications = Notification.objects.filter(recipient=self.authorized_user)
           self.assertEqual(notifications.count(), 1)
           self.assertIn('was late on', notifications.first().message)
   ```

   **Run Tests:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py test employees
   ```

3. **Enhance Security:**

   - **Password Reset Functionality:** Implement password reset for users.
   - **HTTPS:** Ensure that the application uses HTTPS, especially in production.
   - **Input Validation:** Sanitize all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.

4. **Refine User Experience:**

   - **Dashboard Enhancements:** Add more functionalities or insights to both Personnel and Authorized User dashboards.
   - **Responsive Design:** Ensure that all templates are mobile-friendly.

---

### **8. Summary**

By correctly importing the `User` and `Notification` models using Django's `get_user_model` and ensuring that all models are properly defined and referenced, you've resolved the initial issues. Implementing the enhancements as outlined ensures that your attendance tracking system is robust, efficient, and user-friendly.

---

### **Next Steps**

With the core features now fully functional, your next steps could include:

1. **Finalizing Leave Management:**
   - Implement leave approval/rejection workflows more thoroughly.
   - Add email notifications for leave requests and decisions.

2. **Enhancing Reporting:**
   - Develop more comprehensive reports, such as exportable CSV/Excel files.
   - Implement filters and sorting options in the reporting interface.

3. **Implementing Bonus Features:**
   - **Dockerization:** Ensure your Docker setup is optimized for development and production.
   - **Swagger Documentation:** Continuously update and refine your API documentation.

4. **Deployment:**
